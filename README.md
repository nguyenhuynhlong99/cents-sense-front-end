## 👨‍🍳 The Process

Front-End Development
The journey began with building the front-end, inspired by a TikTok video on budgeting using a Notion template. Designing a user-friendly and responsive interface was challenging, given that design is not my specialty, and I’m still striving for the perfect look and feel. After discovering the iOS application BudgetHound, I’m motivated to further enhance my project’s user interface based on its design principles.

Back-End Development
Initially, I considered using JSON Server to start the back-end and then transitioning to Node.js. However, my focus remained on perfecting the user interface, leading me to seek a quicker backend solution. This search led me to Supabase, which turned out to be an excellent choice. Supabase offers a plethora of features out of the box, such as a PostgreSQL database, user authentication, email confirmations for new users, and more, all backed by clear and easy-to-follow documentation.

Deployment
Deployment was seamless with the help of Vercel, making it easy to get the application up and running.
